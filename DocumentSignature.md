When a document's URL fails to uniquely identify a wrapper in the
wrapper repository, the plugin may attempt to query a wrapper by the
document's signature.  Abstractly, the document's signature is a
summary of the document that matches the signature of the document
used to construct the wrapper.  Two documents should have matching
signature iff they were generated by the same template.  For example,
your PNC bank account and my PNC bank account would not be the same
document, but, since they come from the same template, they should
have the same signature.

[Hachenberg and Gottron](https://gae-wrapup-server.googlecode.com/hg/doc/bib/2013_hachenbergLocalitySensitiveHashingWebDocs.pdf)
indicate that simply MD5-hashing the tags in the HTML header provides
a reasonably unique fingerprint for templates.  That paper suggests
several other, more resource-intensive approaches should the simple
approach fail.

The bank account example suggests an important consideration, namely
that the algorithm for computing a signature should maximally preserve
the user's privacy.  Ideally, the server would never receive content
in the signature query, but only structure.  For example, if as
suggested above the tag sequence of the header suffices to uniquely
identify most templates, then the plugin should send only that data,
exposing less of the user's data.
