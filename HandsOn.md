How do we acquire wrappers to train a wrapper-induction system?

We use any source of wrappers we can get our hands on!

One option is to pay professional annotators, as do Yahoo! and other
systems.  But as far as we know, the annotations built by Yahoo! are
proprietary, and we don't have a budget to hire and train our own
annotators.

The
[SmartWrap](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smartwrapclient/)
tool allows end users to quickly and easily develop wrappers for web
datasets.  This tool was used by Turkers (in exchange for a
micropayment of ~$0.40) to generate the training corpus.

[Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) allows python developers to easily write
shareable wrapper scripts.

[ScraperWiki](https://scraperwiki.com/) allows (allowed?) developers to
write and share scripts in a variety of implementation languages.
